## Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Do ward members need to create an account?**
A: No! Ward members just chat with the AI and provide their name and email.

**Q: How do bishopric members set their availability?**
A: They create recurring calendar events (like "INTERVIEW-AVAIL") in their Google/Outlook calendar. The app automatically detects these as available time slots.

**Q: Can this work for multiple wards?**
A: Yes! The system is multi-tenant - one deployment can serve multiple wards. Each ward registers through the "/register" page and gets their own isolated data, but all share the same application instance.

**Q: What if someone needs to reschedule?**
A: Currently, they would need to schedule a new appointment. A rescheduling feature is planned for a future update.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Yes! The app uses industry-standard OAuth 2.0, encrypted connections (HTTPS), and secure session management. Calendar tokens are stored securely in the database.
